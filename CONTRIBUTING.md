# Development Setup

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/advis_distrimuse_unito
cd advis_distrimuse_unito
```

## 2. Create Environment

```bash
conda create -n dm_unito python=3.9.18
conda activate dm_unito
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contribution Workflow
Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

Examples:
```text
feature/new-anomaly-score
fix/inference-memory-bug
docs/readme-update
```

## Coding Guidelines
**Python Style**

- Follow PEP8 conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions modular
- Add comments where necessary

**Deep Learning Code**

- Keep training reproducible
- Save random seeds when possible
- Avoid hardcoded dataset paths
- Make GPU/CPU execution configurable
